> “Success is not luck — it’s discipline.”  

**YOUR APP** is a productivity-focused mobile web app designed to help users organize their daily lives through four core features: **Your Reminder**, **Your Notes**, **Your Goals**, and **Your Tasks**.  
It’s built to encourage better time management, consistent progress tracking, and mindful planning — all in one simple interface.

## 🌟 Features  

### 🕒 **YOUR REMINDER**  
Set reminders for important dates or deadlines. Whether it’s a daily habit, an appointment, or a medication schedule — this feature ensures you never miss what truly matters.  
> 💡 *In future versions, notifications will be added (via user permission) to alert users directly through their device.*

### 📝 **YOUR NOTES**  
Take quick notes, store review materials, or even write your personal diary. Perfect for students or anyone who wants their ideas and thoughts in one place.

### 🎯 **YOUR GOALS**  
Track your short-term and long-term goals. Whether it’s saving up for something big or forming new habits, you can set deadlines and visualize your progress.

### 📋 **YOUR TASKS**  
Plan your day effectively by adding tasks for specific dates. Tasks are categorized by priority — **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** — so you’ll always know what to tackle first.
